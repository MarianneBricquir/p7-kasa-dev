## General Info <a name="part1"></a>

Kasa is a real estate rental showcase site. It presents accommodation available for rent (src directory --> data, announces.json file).
This is the first version of the front-end for updating the site with React.

Then, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is carried out as part of the Openclassrooms Web Developer course.
